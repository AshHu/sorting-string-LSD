# sorting-string-LSD
Sort variable length string alphabetically using LSD radix sort.

Input file has n strings, each with maximum-length of k = 21 characters. The strings consist of only upper-case letters A-Z, with no space and need not be distinct. Each string has at most k characters. Shorter strings must be padded with blank characters (as they are
read from a file) to reach the fixed length of k.

Input the strings from a text file “f.txt”. Assume that each string starts at the beginning of a new
line and ends with one or more white-space-characters. (An end-of-line character is a white-space.)

This program handle the strings on a character-by-character basis, one character at a time.
